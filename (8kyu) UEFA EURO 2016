def uefa_euro_2016(teams, scores):
    if scores[0] > scores[1]:
        return "At match " + teams[0] + " - " + teams[1] + ", " + teams[0] + " won!"
    elif scores[1] > scores[0]:
        return "At match " + teams[0] + " - " + teams[1] + ", " + teams[1] + " won!"
    else:
        return "At match " + teams[0] + " - " + teams[1] + ", teams played draw."
